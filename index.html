<h2> Why did I make this?</h2> 
  <ul>  
    <li>OpenAI recently announced the formation of the Superalignment team. </li>
    <li>This team is now Ilya Sutskever's main research focus and has 20% of OpenAI's compute with strong possibilities of obtaining more if needed. </li>
    <li>This announcement got some media attention and a couple of blog posts, but it seems like nobody's really talking about this now. </li>
    <li>I believe this area (whether correct or misguided) needs significantly more attention, since it's not every day something like this appears. </li> 
    <li>Here's what's going on (from my external, unaffiliated perspective): </li> 
  </ul>
<h2> First off, what is a "superalignment"?</h2> 
  <ul>  
    <li>Give definition -> alignment from paul christiano's definition -> RLHF/CoT stuff </li>
  </ul>
<h2> What's the point of this team? </h2> 
  <ul>  
    <li>Mega-goal is to align superintelligence, but that seems right now to be impossible. So the real goal is much more modest (although incredibly ambitious): align a human-level alignment researcher. </li>
  </ul>
<h2> Ok, so how do we do that? </h2> 
  <ul>  
    <li>Seems unsure, nobody has a "here is 100% of all the low level details" but here are the approaches/mindsets/methods/everything that goes into this. </li>
  </ul>
<h2> Call to action (or, "what can I do?") </h2> 
  <ul>  
    <li>I have no clue. I didn't htink I'd get this far.   </li>
  </ul>
